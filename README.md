# About
A simple python program to count the time you spend doing things. I personally use it for knowing how much time I spend studying each subject during university. You can create events and then track the time you spend on it.

## How to use it
To run it, i recommend having a folder for the program because it generates a pycache file and a json file. You just have to be in the tCount folder and execute:
```
python3 main.py
```
Then, just follow the program indications.
