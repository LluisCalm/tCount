# tCount

## About
A simple python program to count the time you spend doing things. You can create events and then count how much time you spend doing that event.

## How to use it
To run it, i recommend having a folder for the program because it generates a pycache file and a json file. You just have to be in the tCount folder and execute:
```
python3 main.py
```
Then, just follow the program instructions (1 to add a new event, 2 for count the time of an event, 3 for statistics and 4 to end).
